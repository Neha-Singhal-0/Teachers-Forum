# Teachers Forum - Classroom Management Platform

## Overview
**Teachers Forum** is a classroom management platform built using the MERN stack. It allows teachers to create virtual classrooms where they can post notes and manage student access. Students can view available classrooms, request to join with teacher approval, and access notes in the classrooms they've joined. The platform ensures role-based permissions to maintain a controlled and structured learning environment.

## Features

### Teacher Role:
- Create and manage one or more virtual classrooms.
- Post notes in each classroom for students to view.
- Approve or reject student requests to join a classroom.

### Student Role:
- View all available classrooms.
- Request to join classrooms (with teacher approval required).
- Access notes only in classrooms they have been approved to join.

### Access Control:
- Only teachers can create classrooms.
- Students can only join classrooms with explicit approval.
- Students can only view notes for classrooms they have joined.

## Project Folder Structure

- **public/** - Contains static files such as images and other assets.
- **src/** - Houses the main frontend codebase, including components, styles, and pages.
- **server/** - Contains the backend API code (Node.js and Express) to manage user requests and database interactions.
- **.gitignore** - Lists files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **package.json** - Specifies project dependencies and scripts for both frontend and backend.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: The main library used for building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For state management across the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and logic to the web pages.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework used to build the backend API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store user and classroom data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library used to interact with MongoDB.

### Other Tools:
- **Postman** & **Hoppscotch**: API testing tools used to test HTTP requests during development.
- **Vercel**: Used to deploy the frontend.
- **Render**: Used to deploy the backend.

## Live Application

The project is deployed and live. You can access it here:
